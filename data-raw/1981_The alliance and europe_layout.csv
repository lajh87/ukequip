'2,'Text 4,"'The Warsaw Pact is a multilateral military/politico alliance formed by the 'Treaty of Friend- ship, Mutual Assistance and Co-operation' signed in Warsaw on 14 May 1955 by the Govern- ments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania; Albania left the Pact in September 1968. The Pact is committed to the defence only of the European territories of the member states.",'13,'97.80273438
'2,'Text 5,"'The Soviet Union is also linked by bilateral treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Romania. These also have similar bilateral treaties with each other. The essence of East European defence arrangements is not therefore dependent on the Warsaw Treaty as such. The Soviet Union concluded status- of-forces agreements with Poland, East Germany, Romania and Hungary between December 1956 and May 1957, and with Czechoslovakia in October 1968; all remain in effect except the one with Romania, which lapsed in June 1958 when Soviet troops left Romania.",'14,'97.36328125

'2,'Text 6,"'The senior formal political body is the Political Consultative Committee (PCC) which com- prises the First Secretaries of the Communist Parties, Heads of Government or their represen- tatives, the Foreign and the Defence Ministers of all the member countries, the Soviet Chief of General Staff and the Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) and Chief of Staff (C of S) of the Pact Joint High Command. Its executive agency is the Joint Secretariat, with representatives from each country, which is responsible for armaments and logistics and for preparing the PCC's agendas. It also has a Permanent Commission responsible for recommendations on general questions of foreign policy. Both are located in Moscow.",'16,'95.80078125
'2,'Text 7,"'The Council of Foreign Ministers advises the PCC on foreign policy, working with the per- manent Commission and the Combined Secretariat. The senior military body is the Council of Defence Ministers. Chaired by the C-in-C, Warsaw Pact, it includes his C of S, the Deputy Ministers of Defence of the Pact nations, Deputy C-in-C, Soviet Air Defence Forces (whose operational area includes Central Europe), and probably the Inspector-General of the Pact and the Chairman of the Technical Committee. This Council meets infrequently to supervise the work of the Permanent Joint High Command (JHC). That Command is headed by a Soviet Marshal, who is also the Soviet First Deputy Minister of Defence. Each Pact Defence Ministry has a senior general as a permanent representative on the JHC staff, while a Soviet general is assigned to each national HQ, except in Romania. The Staff is responsible for operational plans and for managing the Pact field exercises. The Pact military representatives also form the Mili- tary Council which, chaired by the C-in-C, and including the C of S, advises the JHC on non- operational matters, and controls the Central Administration for training, standardization and, possibly, technical affairs. The offices of C-in-C and C of S and all important staff posts have always been held by Soviet officers.",'17,'96.04492188
'2,'Text 8,"'The JHC controls the Soviet Forces in Eastern Europe and Western USSR. The East Euro- pean Pact armies remain under national control until war breaks out, when they are expected to come under command of the JHC. Among the Soviet military HQ in the Warsaw Pact area are the Group of Soviet Forces, Germany (GSFG) at Zossen-Wünsdorf near Berlin; the North- ern Group of Forces, (NGF) at Legnica, Poland; the Central Group of Forces (CGF) at Milovice, north of Prague, and the Southern Group of Forces (SGF) at Budapest. A Soviet Tactical Air Army is located with each Group of Forces. Command of the air defence system covering the whole Warsaw Pact area, with the probable exception of Romania, is centralized in Moscow and is directed by the C-in-C of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, Voyska Protivovozdushnoy Oborony Strany (PVO Strany).",'18,'94.33593750

The Paris Agreements of 1954 added a Protocol aimed at strengthening the NATO structure and revised the Brussels Treaty, to enable West Germany and Italy to join it. The Treaty had no date of termination. France withdrew from the military organization in 1966; Greece, which left in 1974, has now rejoined it.
