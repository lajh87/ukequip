Total armed forces: 454,330
Defence budget: $4,653,360,000
### Army
Total strength: 200,000
Of this total 53,000 are stationed
in Germany and Berlin, some
20,000 in the Mediterranean,
Middle East and Africa, and
20,000 in the Far East. In
terms of infantry battalions,
the division is: Germany and
Berlin 20; Middle East and
Africa 13; Caribbean 1; Far
East 4. In Malaya, these form
part of a Commonwealth
Brigade Group. There are 7
Gurkha battalions in the Far
East, but one is shortly to be
transferred to Britain.
In terms of formations, 7 brigades
are committed to NATO in
Germany, 1 brigade is in Ber-
lin, 3 brigades are based in the
Middle East and Africa. In the
United Kingdom, 3 brigades,
plus most of the Parachute
Brigade form the strategic
reserve.
The armoured formations in Ger-
many are equipped with Cen-
turion and Conqueror tanks,
some of which have received a
105 mm. howitzer. Three regi-
ments are now equipped with
Honest John and one with
Corporal missiles (see US).
The deployment of the Thun-
derbird anti-aircraft missile is
to be completed soon. The
Vigilant anti-tank missile may
shortly become operational.
### Navy
Total strength: 96,330 men
The operational strength of the
Royal Navy comprises about

due for completion this year)
5 cruisers
20 destroyers
33 frigates
31 submarines (including the
nuclear-powered submarine
Dreadnought)
1 guided-missile destroyer will be
completed in 1962 and will be
be equipped with Sea Slug and
Sea Cat surface-to-air missiles.
An improved version of Sea
Slug is now being developed.
The new anti-submarine heli-
copter Wessex is now coming
into service. Aircraft carriers
are receiving the Scimitar
fighter-bombers and the Sea
Vixen which will be equipped
with the US Sidewinder and
British Firestreak air-to-air
missile respectively.
The first operational squadron of
Buccaneer low-level supersonic
bombers is expected to be
formed in 1962.
### Air Force

Bomber Command
About 180 V-bombers, including
Vulcan Us which can deliver
the Skybolt stand-off bomb
and are now in squadron ser-
vice. Although Blue Steel is
making its final trials, it is
doubtful whether it will be in
service in 1962.
Fighter Command
The supersonic Lightning is now
in service, armed with the
Firestreak air-to-air missile.
This is also carried by the
Javelin all-weather fighter.
The deployment of the Blood-
hound is expected to be com-
pleted early in 1962. An im-
proved version, capable of
being transported by air, is
also being developed.
The BMEWS station at Fyling-
dale should be completed by
the summer of 1962.
Coastal Command
Main equipment is the high-
endurance Shackleton which
can remain airborne for 24
hours without refuelling.
Transport Command
Main force for long-distance air-
lift comprises 23 Britannias and
10 Comets. They are supple-
mented by the medium-range
Beverley and Hastings aircraft.
5 Argosies will be in service by
the end of 1961.
Tactical Aircraft
The Canberra, of which the later
versions are capable of 580
m.p.h. at 40,000 feet, and the
Hunter fighter, speed 700 m.p.h.
are the basic aircraft of RAF
tactical power overseas.
UNITED STATES
### General
Population: 181,000,000
Military service: Selective service

are volunteers
Total armed forces: 2,606,000
Estimated defence expenditure:
$48,506,000,000
### Army
Total strength: 967,000
The Army consists of a Strategic
Army Corps of two airborne
and one infantry divisions, and
11 combat divisions. The pre-
sent increase to over 1,000,000
by the end of 1961 will raise
the number of combat divisions
to 16.
The Seventh Army of 5 divisions
and 3 armoured brigades, and
comprising 200,000 men, is
allocated to NATO and sta-
tioned in Germany. This
strength may be increased to
300,000 during 1962. Three
divisions are stationed in the
Far East.

propelled M55 howitzer is also
in use. It has a range of over
10 miles and can fire a nuclear
shell. Most armoured units are
still equipped with the 44-ton
M48 tank.
### Navy
Total strength: 635,787
The Navy consists of 819 opera-
tional ships (383 warships, 232

organized into four fleets (1st,
2nd, 6th and 7th), each of
which includes attack carriers,
anti-submarine carriers, sur-
face and sub-surface anti-sub-
marine forces, cruisers, and
associated logistic and amphi-
bious forces.
The attack carriers Constellation
and Kitty Hawk have been
commissioned and the Navy
has received the nuclear-pow-
ered attack carrier Enterprise
and the nuclear-powered
cruiser Long Beach. Seventeen
new destroyers and frigates
armed with guided missiles
have joined the fleet in recent
years and 28 more are under
construction.
The Navy has 21 nuclear-pow-
ered submarines in service, six
of which are fleet ballistic
missile submarines.
In August 1961, the Navy an-
nounced that it would operate
one additional attack carrier
and air group. 22 amphibious
ships and 11 fleet support ships
are also to be reactivated. The
Navy will operate one addi-
tional support carrier and air
group for anti-submarine war-
fare purposes and purchase
additional air and surface
launched guided missiles. One
attack transport, one destroyer
and five destroyer escorts due
for withdrawal from active
service will be retained.
