The December 2000 Nice summit failed to resolve the central question: the feasibility of having a 60,000-strong force ready for deployment by 2003. And there is less talk about 'rapid reaction' and more about 'planned options' for likely scenarios. Meanwhile, the Balkan crisis shows no sign of disappearing, with the crisis in Macedonia unresolved and NATO pledged to provide a brigade-size force to disarm rebels once there is a stable cease-fire agreement.

In particular, combat support capabilities - such as airlift and air-to-air refuelling - will have to be greatly enhanced if a credible force is to be fielded for peacekeeping operations either in Europe or beyond. Another problem is the operational overstretch of some European armed forces. For example, the UK has some 40% of its army deployed or preparing for operations. In this context, it is hard to see how any significant extra commitment can be taken on. Aside from these practical problems of capability, overstretch and finance, there are considerable political difficulties. Turkey, which is not an EU member, is reluctant to agree to a European force drawing on NATO assets, and France is against sharing key NATO capabilities. There is also the concern, voiced by Ireland after the December 2000 Nice conference, that in a pan-European force, national influence over decision- making on deployment of national forces may be diluted. Nevertheless, plans have gone ahead. The EU Military Staff (EUMS) became operational on 11 June 2001 and had its first meeting with the NATO Military Committee on 12 June.",'24,'97.60742188

The US favours the Baltic option, whereas some NATO European states, such as France, would like to see enlargement in south-eastern Europe, although the qualifications of the most strategically and economically significant NATO applicant in that region - Romania - have been slipping. There is also some support for accession by Bulgaria, Slovakia and Slovenia, but neither Albania nor Macedonia are likely to meet the criteria for membership in this round. The most contentious issue is the prospective membership of the Baltic States, which is strongly opposed by Russia. Moscow views the Baltic States as part of the Russian sphere of influence and a key strategic area. These countries are geographically, ethnically and historically close to Russia. The position of Kaliningrad, a Russian region separated from the Federation and flanked by potential NATO member Lithuania and current member Poland, is an added reason for Russian sensitivity about NATO membership for the Baltic states. Given this context, Russia's participation in the NATO Baltops naval exercise in July 2001 was an encouraging sign of willingness to cooperate militarily in the Baltic area.",'41,'99.21875000

The withdrawal was complete by the 1 July 2001 deadline and intense negotiations continue between the Georgians and the Russians over the closure of the other three bases - Gudauta, Akhalkalaki and Batumi. Gudauta, located in the separatist region of Abkhazia, was also to have been closed by 1 July 2001; however, the Russians, who maintain a peacekeeping force in this disputed region, claim that it is unsafe to close the base. The Abkhaz, who see the Russian presence as crucial to their future security and a deterrent to any Georgian military attempt to recapture Abkhazia, would resist such a move, possibly with violence. The Russian preference is for the base to be turned into a rehabilitation and logistic base for the peacekeeping force, thereby maintaining a foothold in the area. Georgia, which would not be able to verify any withdrawal of Russian troops from the disputed territory, has reached a compromise agreement with the Russians on the status of the base. Russian peacekeepers already deployed in Abkhazia will guard installations at the Gudauta base. They will be lightly armed, and the Georgian government is to approve a list of their weapons.

The Russian proposal is for a flexible system of rapid response triggered by accurate threat analysis, rather than setting up a permanent structure. This proposal would require an upgraded S-300 air defence system and possibly an integrated multinational warning system. There is widespread scepticism about the feasibility of the Russian proposal.

In the Ukraine, the defence budget for 2001 rose in local currency terms by h75om to h3. 1bn ($580m). The minimum needed to maintain the current armed forces is thought to be around h6bn ($1.1bn). The defence budget allocated just 14% to procurement, upgrades and weapons modernisation, detailing as priorities the procurement of 65 AN-70 aircraft and upgrades to the fleet of MiG29 and Su-25 attack aircraft. As in recent years, the gap between the official budget and the actual requirement was to be 'found through economies'.",'92,'96.19140625

The sweeping changes to force structure and the need for improved intelligence and command-and-control assets have led to around 50% of the defence budget being spent on procurement and research.
