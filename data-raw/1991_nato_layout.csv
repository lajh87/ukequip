'2,'Text 6,"'It has been a significant 12 months for NATO: the signing of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty (CFE); the unification of Germany within the Atlantic Alliance; the reduction of the Soviet threat brought about by the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and the agree- ments to withdraw all Soviet armed forces from eastern Europe. As a result of these changes NATO has embarked on a review of its strategy, operational plans and deployment. NATO first signalled its intentions with the London Declaration of 6 July 1990 which stated that 'NATO will prepare a new Allied military strategy moving away from ""forward defence"" where appropriate, towards a reduced forward presence and modifying ""flexible response"" to reflect a reduced reliance on nuclear weapons' and 'a new NATO strategy making nuclear forces truly weapons of last resort'.",'12,'98.73046875
'2,'Text 7,"'The initial euphoria induced by the end of the Cold War, however, has not yet resulted in a military. reorganization in Western Europe. A number of new factors have complicated the scene: virtually all NATO members have embarked on reviews of their armed forces and their contribution to NATO; most are set on making significant force reductions, and treasuries are seeking an elusive, so-called 'peace dividend'. SHAPE has been developing its plans for a restructured NATO force but these have been stymied to some extent by the emerging contro- versy over the shape of European security and whether the EC should develop common foreign and defence policies, in addition to economic and political union. SHAPE is waiting to be informed about the final structure of national forces and member nations are waiting to know what NATO's plans are and what is expected of them. All this has been further compli- cated by the Gulf War and the re-emergence of possible 'out of area' (OOA) roles for multinational standby forces. If not deployed under NATO command, these forces could be 'double hatted' and earmarked for European-sponsored operations (possibly under WEU control) as well as for NATO or national roles.",'13,'97.46093750
'2,'Text 8,"'In any event, the ratification of the CFE Treaty has been delayed because of apparent Soviet dissemblance (detailed on p. 30), and no progress has yet been made in tackling the outstanding CFE matters of limits on military manpower and aerial inspection. Work has not yet started on drafting a mandate for an arms-control treaty covering short-range nuclear weapons.",'14,'72.41210938
'2,'Text 9,"'At the NATO Defence Planning Committee meeting on 28 and 29 May 1991 a general outline and some details of how NATO's Central Region would be structured were given, pending the outcome of NATO's strategy review planned for November 1991. There would be four types of forces: immediate reaction; rapid reaction; main defences; and augmentation. The immediate reaction force would be modelled on the ACE Mobile Force and would con- tain as many national contingents as possible so as to increase its political profile; in peace- time, units in the ACE Mobile Force are already committed to SACEUR and so theoretically can be deployed without lengthy political discussion. The rapid reaction force would be a multinational corps based on those elements of the 1st British Corps which will remain in Germany. It may comprise four divisions: a British armoured division of three brigades based in Germany; a British division based in the UK which would include the airborne brigade, two mechanized brigades and, when necessary, the commando brigade; a multinational air mobile division with brigades found by the UK, Germany and the Netherlands with a Belgian element; and a Southern Flank division, whose detailed composition has not yet been announced, probably commanded by an Italian. The Corps would be commanded by a British General. It would be available for operations throughout NATO and it is possible that some form of 'double hatting' may be introduced to allow the corps, or at any rate major elements of it, to be prepared for OOA operations not under NATO command. All units in the Corps would be active though there will still be conscripts in most units other than the British. The main defence forces will be both active and reserve. In the NATO Central Region there will be five corps: two German, one US and two multinational but based around Belgian and Dutch forces. There will be two further Corps: a joint Danish-German Corps for the defence of the",'15,'94.67773438

At present no details are available regarding the restructuring of ground forces outside the Central Region, nor of naval and air forces, nor is it known whether the command organization will be changed.",'18,'98.48632813
'3,'Text 11,"'Most NATO countries have announced substantial reductions to their armed forces, and there will be withdrawals of forces from Germany by all countries which have troops based there. The largest reductions will be made by Germany (which must reduce its combined ground and air force manpower to 370,000 as agreed under the terms of the 'Two Plus Four' agreement on German unification), and by the UK and France.",'19,'96.63085938
'3,'Text 12,"'The next 12 months will be a busy time for NATO as national forces are restructured and multinational plans developed, approved and tested. Should CFE be ratified, there will also be a measure of equipment elimination for NATO but not on the same scale as for the Soviet Union and the former members of the Warsaw Pact (see pp. 229-34 for details). The policy of 'cascading', or 'harmonization' as it has come to be called, will be put into practice. This involves the transfer of more modern surplus equipments to countries armed with less modern versions, and the destruction of their original holdings of older weapons to keep within CFE limits. Finally, there will be verification measures, predominantly inspections both to be mounted and to be received. Most NATO countries have established verification units which provide both inspectors and the infrastructure for managing inspection on their territory.",'20,'97.85156250

'3,'Text 13,"'Apart from the US, only two NATO members supplied both ground and air forces to the coalition facing Iraq: the UK and France (Italy and Canada committed air forces only). France was severely restricted in the size of force that it could deploy by the political decision not to send conscripts to the Middle East. Although the UK has all volunteer forces it also faced manpower problems as many units were understrength and others (particularly artil- lery) rely heavily on reservists to expand from peace to war establishment. Reservists would normally provide all the manpower needed to form battle casualty replacement units, and the Territorial Army (TA) provides the bulk of the medical and transport units which reinforce the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) in wartime. Only medical reservists were recalled for service in the Gulf, some TA and reserves volunteered for a special engagement, and the Reg- ular Army provided the remainder of the shortfall. The British armoured division which deployed to the Gulf with only two brigades plus logistic support took nearly half the man- power of BAOR (an eight brigade sized force). If NATO or a European defence organization is to form a rapid reaction force with OOA roles it must address these two manning problems: volunteer versus conscript forces; and reliance on reserve forces.",'22,'97.46093750
'3,'Text 14,"'Most NATO countries deployed naval units east of Suez to take part in operations to enforce UN sanctions. A measure of co-ordination and co-operation amongst the European navies was instituted by the Western European Union (WEU). While all the navies played a role in enforc- ing the sanctions, only US and UK naval ships later took part in Operations Desert Storm and Desert Sabre. Other non-belligerent naval support was provided. Germany sent a force of mine countermeasure ships to the eastern Mediterranean (these then moved to the Gulf to take part in post-war mineclearing operations), and later sent an exercise group into the Mediterranean to allow other NATO units to move through the Suez Canal without reducing NATO's naval presence. Portugal played a role by contributing sealift. Both NATO's Standing Force Atlantic and Standing Force Channel were deployed on training to the Mediterranean. In January, the UK aircraft carrier Ark Royal also deployed to the Mediterranean.",'23,'97.07031250

The main group was based in Turkey and set up camps in 'safe havens' in north Iraq. Contingents were sent by the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain (the first occasion this century that Spanish troops have served outside Spanish terri- tory or colonies).

'4,'Text 18,"'France's SSBN force has been reduced by one: Le Redoutable was taken out of service in Feb- ruary 1991 and decommissioning will be completed in October 1991. Four SSBN remain operational, one (Le Foudroyant) remains in long refit (completion due in early 1993) and Le Triomphant is still under construction and scheduled to be operational in 1994. France is in the process of reviewing the future of its nuclear triad, with a strong chance that only one delivery system (an IRBM or an air-launched stand-off missile) will be deployed alongside five rather than six SSBN. However, it has been decided that the S-3 SSM replacement will not be the mobile S-45 IRBM. The SSM component of France's 'prestrategic' nuclear forces is to be modernized, with a first Hadès regiment replacing Pluton in the spring of 1992. A second regiment is planned, but it is doubtful whether a third will be deployed. Pluton, currently deployed in five regiments, will be gradually phased out. France has indicated its decision to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The UK's Vanguard-class SSBN construction con- tinues on schedule with the third submarine being laid down in early 1991. There are fre- quent press reports of faults affecting the UK Polaris force which may comprise only one fully serviceable SSBN. A decision to replace free-fall nuclear bombs with a stand-off weapon has been delayed and must now be complicated by the uncertainty over the make-up of French nuclear forces. Following the withdrawal by the US of its nuclear warheads, Germany has destroyed all its 72 Pershing 1A SSM; it inherited some 20 SS-23 missiles from the NVA which are to be destroyed. There has been no progress towards instituting SNF treaty nego- tiations, but it is generally accepted that there is no longer a role for ground-launched nuclear weapons and that both SSM and artillery warheads should be withdrawn.",'30,'97.41210938

'5,'Text 23,"'German armed forces face major problems as they: absorb former NVA units into the Bundeswehr (being drastically reduced from six active and five mobilization divisions to six Home Defence brigades in the eastern part of Germany); reallocate weapons and equipment to standardize unit holdings predominantly with western equipments, and begin the process of eliminating large numbers of CFE TLE and dispose of large quantities of material not cov- ered by the Treaty and ammunition for which there is no further use in the Bundeswehr. Ger- many is committed by the 'Two Plus Four' treaty to reducing in the next three to four years the strength of the armed forces to 370,000, of whom no more than 345,000 can be in the Army and Air Force. It is planned to allocate the 370,000 posts as follows: 260,000 to the Army, 83,000 Air Force and 26,200 Navy. Large numbers of former NVA soldiers, including about 40,000 officers and senior NCOs, have already been retired. 17,000 officers and NCOs have been retained at present only on a two-year contract. West German officers were sur- prised on three counts when they took over command of the former NVA: the appalling liv- ing conditions of both officers and men; the very high state of readiness maintained by all units and, in contradiction to the first point, the high standard of maintenance of equipment; and the much larger than estimated stocks of ammunition. Bundeswehr officers now hold all command appointments in the Eastern Command. With the exception of BMP fighting vehicles and MiG-29 aircraft, all former NVA equipment is to be disposed of, The Military Balance therefore lists them as 'in store'. The Army has brought 27 more MLRS and 20 more Roland SP SAM into service during the last year. The Navy has taken delivery of four more Hameln MCM vessels and the Air Force has much improved its air-defence capability, having added 34 more Roland and 48 Patriot SAM launchers to its inventory.",'38,'97.85156250
