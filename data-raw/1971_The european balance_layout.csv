'2,'Text 4,"'The Warsaw Pact is a multilateral military alliance formed by a 'Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Co-operation', which was signed in Warsaw on 14 May 1955 by the Governments of the Soviet Union, Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Rumania. (Albania denounced the Pact in September 1968.) According to East European docu- mentary sources the Pact is committed to the defence of only the European territories of the member states.",'14,'97.21679688
'2,'Text 5,"'The Soviet Union is also linked by bilateral treaties of friendship and mutual assistance with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Rumania. All present members of the Warsaw Pact also have similar bilateral treaties with each other. The Soviet Union con- cluded status-of-forces agreements with Poland, East Germany, Rumania and Hungary between December 1956 and May 1957 and with Czechoslovakia in October 1968; all these remain in effect except the one with Rumania which lapsed in June 1958 when Soviet troops left Rumania. The essence of East European defence arrangements is not therefore dependent on the Warsaw Treaty as such.",'15,'96.43554688

'2,'Text 7,"'The first, the Political Consultative Committee, consists, in full session, of the First Secretaries of the Communist Party, Heads of Government and the Foreign and Defence Ministers of the member-countries. It met twice in the year up to July 1971, at which point there had been 17 meetings in all*. The Committee has a Joint Secretariat, headed by a Soviet officer, consisting of a specially appointed official from each country, and a Permanent Commission, whose task is to make recommendations on general questions of foreign policy for Pact members. Both these bodies are located in Moscow.",'18,'86.62109375
'2,'Text 8,"'The second body, the Joint High Command, is directed, according to the Treaty, 'to strengthen the defensive capability of the Warsaw Pact, to prepare military plans in case of war and to decide on the deployment of troops'. The Command consists of a Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C), a Defence Committee, made up of the six Defence Ministers of the Pact, which acts as an advisory body, and a Military Council. This body, which is modelled on a similar organization in the Soviet Armed Forces, meets under the chairmanship of the C-in-C, and includes the Chief of Staff (C of S) and permanent military representatives from each of the allied armed forces. (It seems to be the main channel through which the Pact's orders are transmitted to its forces in peacetime, and through which the East European forces are able to put their point of view to the C-in-C.) The Pact also has a Military Staff, which has been enlarged by additional non-Soviet senior officers. The posts of C-in-C and C of S of the Joint High Command have, however, always been held by Soviet officers, and most of the key positions are still in Soviet hands. In the event of war, the forces of the other Pact members would be operationally subordinate to the Soviet High Command. The command of the air defence system covering the whole Warsaw Pact area is centralized in Moscow and directed by the C-in-C of the Soviet Air Defence Forces.",'19,'93.79882813
