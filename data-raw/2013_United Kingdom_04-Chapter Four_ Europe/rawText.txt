Many RN and RAF capabilities have reduced by 20-30%
as a result of cuts made in the 2010 Strategic Defence and
Security Review. Some cuts, such as maritime patrol air-

Command has taken over strategic intelligence, special
Spacetrack Radar at Incirlik
forces and other joint strategic capabilities. The Army
2020 programme will likewise reduce the regular Brit-
ish Army's overall capability by 20-30% by 2018 and will
greatly increase dependence on reserves. It does, how-
ever, retain many of the capabilities specially developed
for Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the government has
stated an aspiration to rebuild capability after 2015, it is
not clear that this can be afforded. Indeed, unless the UK
economy improves, sustaining existing capability may
prove problematic, particularly if equipment or person-
nel costs increase beyond current planning assumptions.
The regeneration of a capability for contingency operations
is planned as force levels in Afghanistan reduce. This has
begun with amphibious, air-assault and naval-reaction
forces. In the longer term, although the size of the forces
has reduced, MoD is still funding some ambitious mod-
ernisation programmes for all three services. Overall, the
UK armed forces maintain a high standard of training, but
the combination of a redundancy programme and new
constraints on pay, allowances and pensions could trigger
an outflow of experienced staff.
