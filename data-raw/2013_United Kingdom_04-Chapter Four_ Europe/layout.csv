'1,'Text 19,"'Many RN and RAF capabilities have reduced by 20-30% as a result of cuts made in the 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review. Some cuts, such as maritime patrol air- craft and NBC reconnaissance, reduce the overall flex- ibility of British forces whilst increasing their dependence on NATO and multinational partners. A new Joint Forces Command has taken over strategic intelligence, special forces and other joint strategic capabilities. The Army 2020 programme will likewise reduce the regular Brit- ish Army's overall capability by 20-30% by 2018 and will greatly increase dependence on reserves. It does, how- ever, retain many of the capabilities specially developed for Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the government has stated an aspiration to rebuild capability after 2015, it is not clear that this can be afforded. Indeed, unless the UK economy improves, sustaining existing capability may prove problematic, particularly if equipment or person- nel costs increase beyond current planning assumptions. The regeneration of a capability for contingency operations is planned as force levels in Afghanistan reduce. This has begun with amphibious, air-assault and naval-reaction forces. In the longer term, although the size of the forces has reduced, MoD is still funding some ambitious mod- ernisation programmes for all three services. Overall, the UK armed forces maintain a high standard of training, but the combination of a redundancy programme and new constraints on pay, allowances and pensions could trigger an outflow of experienced staff.",'23,'93.84765625

This 'National Cyber Security Programme' is supported by some £650m - with programme manage- ment by OSCIA - and led to a new Cyber Security Strategy, published in November 2011. A UK Defence Cyber Opera- tions Group was set up in 2011 to place 'cyber at the heart of defence operations, doctrine and training'.
